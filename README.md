This is an ansible role intended to be used to configure a Debian Linux system 
as an AX.25 over IP node.

It has been tested on Raspberry Pi OS Lite (bullseye).

The variables defined in defaults/main.yml should be overriden to define your callsign
and other relevant parameters for your environment.
